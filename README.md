# Sentiment-Analysis-NLP---ML
Leveraging NLP  and advanced ML methods for Sentiment Analysis

# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Introduction
**Project Title:** Sentiment Analysis using Various Machine Learning Algorithms  
**Objective:** To analyze and predict the sentiment of text data using various machine learning algorithms and techniques.  
**Scope:** This project involves preprocessing text data, applying different vectorization techniques, and building models to classify the sentiment.

## Libraries and Tools
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Gensim
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed noise, such as HTML tags, special characters, etc.
- **Tokenization:** Split text into individual words or tokens.
- **Lemmatization:** Reduced words to their base forms.
- **Stop Words Removal:** Removed common words that do not contribute much to the sentiment analysis.

## Vectorization Techniques
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):** Weighted terms based on their frequency and importance.
- **Word2Vec:** Generated word embeddings based on word context.
- **Bag of Words:** Counted the occurrence of each word in a document.
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique):** Balanced the dataset by generating synthetic samples.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
- **Naive Bayes:** A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
- **Logistic Regression:** A linear model for binary classification.
- **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method for classification that builds multiple decision trees.

## Model Evaluation
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visualized the performance of the classification model.
- **Cross-Validation:** Evaluated the model performance on different subsets of the data.

## Results
- **Comparison of Algorithms:** Evaluated and compared the performance of different models.
  - Naive Bayes: Achieved an accuracy of X%, precision of Y%, recall of Z%, and F1-Score of W%.
  - Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy of X%, precision of Y%, recall of Z%, and F1-Score of W%.
  - Random Forest: Achieved an accuracy of X%, precision of Y%, recall of Z%, and F1-Score of W%.
- **Best Model:** The Random Forest model had the highest performance metrics with an accuracy of X%, precision of Y%, recall of Z%, and F1-Score of W%.

## Conclusion
- **Summary:** The project successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms in sentiment analysis. The Random Forest model provided the best performance among the evaluated models.
- **Future Work:** Future improvements could include exploring deep learning models, optimizing hyperparameters, and using larger datasets for training.
